# Our Programming Team
The programmers on our team are the ones behind autonomous and teleop. They are a crucial part of the team as they allow the robot to function and without them, it would be very embarrassing for our team. The programmers have run hundreds of tests to ensure our team scores the most points in autonomous. (Autonomous refers to the period of time before the drivers take control, and when the programmers preprogram a route for the robot to score points before the match) Programming our robot has taken hundreds of hours of hard work and dedication and we can’t thank our programmers enough!!

“Our robot runs in Java, a challenging programming language that allows our robot to do many things, but in a difficult way.” This is a great quote from Luke Dabell, an important programmer on our team and asked his opinion on the programming language of our robot. Luke belives that Java was not the best choice for a programming language as it can be challenging and overly detailed, but it still gets the job done and works on many different devices. Java also allows our robot to do many different and difficult tasks, is great for object-oriented programming, and most importantly, it’s free!

I talked to Leo Chaudhary-Kim, our lead programmer about what he has to say about the robot and programming. “Programming is very multifaceted and interesting. It is important for our robot to score the most points in autonomous and teleop.” (Teleop is the period of time where the drivers control the robot, and you rely on their instincts to score the most points.) Leo believes that Java was an overall good choice, given our choices, as it allows the programmers to learn java better for the upcoming AP CS test.
